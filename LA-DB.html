<!--Brendon S. Busic - Notes of Progres

This game is based off of a dice game briefly mentioned in the Web Toon comic: 'Hardcore Leveling Warrior', where players fight by rolling dice instead of relying on their respective skill levels in this fantasy VR-MMORPG

I did NOT come up with this game myself, I only created this webpage that allows people to play the game with a computer

Started: 6/10/2019
	6/10/2019
		- Created the advRules list 
		- Created the basicRules table to make the rules easier to understand, and hid the advRules list
	6/11/2019
		- Styled the basicRules table and added images to them
		- Created the JS for rolling both the player's and computer's dice
	6/12/2019
		- Created the game play area for both the Player and the Computer
		- Added images of dice for both areas
		- Created a table that will display what the players will be doing (based on what they have rolled)
		- Added three more rules pretaining to attacking and defending
		- Edited the font of the tables
		- Edited the result tables by adding <span/> elements everywhere; will be used later to display to the user what values have been achieved in addition to the images of the dice
6/13/2019 - Plans: create the events table, add HP gauges, and make the results tables update and show what values have been rolled
	6/16/2019
		- Added JavaScript that would change the colors of the actions of each player so it would be easier to notice as opposed to JUST relying on the user understanding the pictures of the dice and the games
	6/17/2019
		- [temporarily?] Removed the rules of continuous rolling due to simplification of code & gameplay
		- Made the lower of the two dice between the Red and Blue dice lower opacity to make it easier to recognize where the power level was coming from
		- Added a message area that tells the player exactly what they will be doing
		- Added a basic health bar that doesn't update from the events of the game yet, and is instead triggered by a button for ease of testing
	6/20/2019
		- Created an orange 'damage bar' that slowly shrinks when the player takes damage to more easily show the user what amount of damage they took
	6/21/2019
		- Created an animation to shake the health bar of the player that is taking damage, to reasily bring the user's attention to the health bar (and also it looks nice)
		- Started working on animation for the dice
	6/22/2019
		- Created the function for shaking the dice as a way to have them visually roll
	6/23/2019
		- Worked on making the dice animation fit in with the existing code of rolling the dice
		- Removed some older functions that were oboslete
		- Made the 'Roll the Dice' button disabled while the dice are rolling in order to prevent errors (created logic errors and visual bugs)
		
* FINISHED THE MAJORITY OF THE JAVASCRIPT *
		- Worked on the css of the game to give it a more refined look and feel
		- Discovered a bug when restarting the game; the health bars don't reset correctly

     In depth- How to Play:
	 <li>After deciding which player goes first, they will roll the die first</li>
	 <li>The <i>White Die</i> decides whether you Attack or Defend</li>
	 <li>If it's an <i>Even Number</i>, you defend!</li>
	 <li>If it's an <i>Odd Number</i>, you attack!</li>
	 <li>Then you will roll two dice; a Red and Blue</li>
	 <li>If the number on the <i>Blue Die</i> is greater, then you will attack or defend using Magic Damage</li>
	 <li>If the number on the <i>Red Die</i> is greater, then you will attack or defend using Physical Damage</li>
	 <li><sub><i>Magic defence can only defend against Magic attacks, and Physical defence can only defend against Physical attacks, unless <b>both numbers are the same</b>.</i></sub></li>
	 <br/>
	 <li>If there are three dices with the same numbers, you roll again.</li>
	 <li>If there are two dices with the same numbers, it's a double</li>
	 <li>If there are three dices with the same numbers, it's a triple</li>
	 <li>When you roll again, you add those numbers to that roll</li>
	 <li>
	  <sub>
	   For example, if
	   Player 1 rolls: [Red:3 Blue:2 White:2] and if
				  <!-- [P1- Physical defense of 3] -->
	   Player 2 rolls: [Red:1 Blue:2 White:3],then
				  <!-- [P2 - Magical Attack of 2] -->
	   Player 1 would <i>defend</i> with a <i>Physical</i> rating of 3 and
	   Player 2 would <i>attack</i> with a <i>Magic</i> rating of 2.
	   In this scenario, P1 would take 2 damage. However, if P2 had rolled [Blue:3] then their attack would be negated.
	  </sub>
	 </li>
	 <br/>
	 <li>If both players roll Even Numbers, they both take damage</li>
	 <li>If both players roll Odd Numbers, the numbers get added to rolls next turn</li>
